# TensorFlow-image-classification

This is a tutorial for image classification of clothing, using neural networks.
In the tutorial we are training the neural network model to classify individual articles
of clothing based on low resolution images (28 x 28 pixels).

The dataset is the Fashion MNIST dataset that is built-in in TensorFlow, and contains 70 000 grayscale
images in 10 categories. In this tutorial I am using 60 000 images to train the network and 10 000 images
to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. 

##### The 10 categories in this tutorial:

| Label | Class         |
| :---: |    ------     |
| 0     | T-shirt / top |
| 1     | Trouser       |
| 2     | Pullover      |
| 3     | Dress         |
| 4     | Coat          |
| 5     | Sandal        |
| 6     | Shirt         |
| 7     | Sneaker      |
| 8     | Bag           |
| 9     | Ankle boot    |
